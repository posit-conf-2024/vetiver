## Explore the data 👀

```{python}
import pandas as pd
housing = pd.read_parquet('../data/housing.parquet')
housing.head()
```

Explore the `housing` data on your own!

```{python}
housing.groupby('waterfront').price.agg('mean')
```

```{python}

```

## Build a model 🔧

Spend your data budget:

```{python}
from sklearn import model_selection
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(123)
X, y = housing[["bedrooms", "bathrooms", "sqft_living", "yr_built"]], np.log10(
    housing["price"]
)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = model_selection.train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
```

Train a logistic regression model:

```{python}
from sklearn import linear_model

housing_fit = linear_model.LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Create a deployable model object 🏺

```{python}
from vetiver import VetiverModel
v = VetiverModel(___, ___, ___)
v.description
```

```{python}
## create a vetiver model with a custom description
```

## Version your model 📌

```{python}
## create a temp board and pin your model
from pins import board_temp
from vetiver import vetiver_pin_write

board = ___
___(board, v)
```

```{python}
## retrieve your model metadata
board.pin_meta(___)
```

## Publish your model on Posit Connect 🚀

- Create an API key on Connect: <https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/api-keys/>
- Store it as `CONNECT_API_KEY` in `.env`

```{python}
## now write your model pin to Posit Connect
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pins import board_connect
load_dotenv()

board = ___
___(board, v)
```

Visit your pin's homepage on Connect.

## Store a new version 👯

Train your model with a new algorithm:

```{python}
from sklearn import tree

housing_fit = tree.DecisionTreeRegressor().fit(___, ___)
```

Store this new model as a new version of the same pin:

```{python}
v = VetiverModel(___, ___)
___(board, v)
```

What versions do you have?

```{python}
board.pin_versions(___)
```
